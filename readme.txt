Info for Update from 1.4.6 to the new 2.0 Version:
The good news: it’s much easer, faster, with better graphic quality and camera functions as the old one – The bad news is: it is not more compatible to the last plugin version below version 2.0!

So, please delete all short-code entries of old Canvasio3D Light in all pages. (In the Canvasio3D 2.0 can you see the little new short-code for "copy & paste" to insert in your page)
